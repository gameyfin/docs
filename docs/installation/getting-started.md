# Getting Started with Gameyfin

After installing Gameyfin and opening the web interface, you will be greeted with the setup page.  
This page will guide you through the initial configuration of Gameyfin.  

## Initial Setup

Choose your preferred theme and click on the right arrow to proceed.  
You will then be asked to create an admin account.  
That's it! You can now log in with your new admin account.

## Configuring the Plugins

Gameyfin comes with a set of pre-installed plugins that provide various functionalities.  
You need to enable and configure the plugins you want to use.  
To do this, go to the **Plugins** section in the admin interface (click on your avatar in the top right corner).  

### Plugin Management Page
Here you will see a list of all available plugins and by clicking on the **Configure** button you can access the configuration page of each plugin.  
The page also contains a short documentation for each plugin, which explains its functionality and how to use it.  

### Plugin Priority
On the right hand side, you will find a button to prioritize the plugins.  
For game metadata plugins, the order in which they are listed determines how Gameyfin will search for metadata.  
For download providers, the order determines which provider will be shown on top of the list for your users.

### Enabling Plugins
To enable a plugin, click on the **On/Off** button next to the **Configure** button.  
If your configuration is valid (you can check this by saving the configuration or by clicking the **Cirle Arrow** button above the configuration options), the plugin will be enabled, and you will see a green checkmark at the bottom of the plugin card.

## Libraries
Go to the **Libraries** section in the admin interface to add your media libraries.  
You can do this by clicking on the **Add Library** button near the bottom of the page.  
Add at least one source folder to the library, so Gameyfin can scan your media files.  
After that you can configure the library and its contents by clicking on the **Configure** button.

## Games
After you have scanned your first library, you can go to the home page of Gameyfin and browse your library.

## Next Steps
You can now start using Gameyfin!
